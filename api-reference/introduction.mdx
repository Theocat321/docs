    management, experimentation, and usage tracking.

## Welcome to the PromptStream API

The PromptStream API lets you version prompts, run A/B experiments, track outcomes, and meter usage—all via simple HTTP endpoints.

We use an **OpenAPI specification** to define every route and model.

## Authentication

All endpoints require your organisation’s API key in an HTTP header:

```http
X-API-Key: YOUR_PROMPTSTREAM_API_KEY
```
